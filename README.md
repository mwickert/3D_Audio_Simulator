# 3D_Audio_Simulator

Jupyter notebooks for 3D audio rendering into headphones using head related impulse response (HRIR) data sets. The corresponding SciPy2019 paper is available at http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2019/mark_wickert.html.

* Three notebooks used in the preparation of the 3D Audio Simulator paper for SciPy 2019 are contain in the `notebooks` folder of this project
* The PDF rendered version of the notebooks are also available in the documents folder:
    - [Binaural_Audio](documents/Binaural_Audio.pdf)
    - [Spherical_Head](documents/Spherical_Head.pdf)
    - [CIPIC_read_write](documents/CIPIC_read_write.pdf)
